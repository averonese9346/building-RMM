This repository contains files for a project that I created for my Artificial Intelligence graduate course. The objective was to create an RNN and compare that model against a popular LLM. I chose to create a model that was trained on fantasy data sets in order to create character outlines and arcs for Dungeons and Dragons campagins. 
The resulting code are most of the preparation files for this task. There are a few more; however, they are too large for Github's 25 MB limit. All of the .py files are included, but some of the .json files were too large.
